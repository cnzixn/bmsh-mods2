Heya there!

Welcome to my mod of a mod of don't starve, Wilton version 2!

I saw the original version of Wilton by debugman18 and thought that the concept was cool, but it the execution was lackluster.

I mean, really now, no hunger? No starvation? In Don't starve? That's not a fair experience. That's player-biased.

So I figured I'll modify that mod to my own preference and have lotsa fun doing so.

And I did!

I balanced this character to make him a challenge while still having fun items to play with.

I want to share what I've completed so far with you guys, since I think it could be a nice refreshing new character (Since every other character is overpowered as fuck except one or two)

This mod works best with Reign of Giants. It should work just fine with the vanilla game, but please report any crashes if they happen. 
Shipwrecked should work just fine with this mod :).

Enjoy!

More information about the mod is on the workshop page!
